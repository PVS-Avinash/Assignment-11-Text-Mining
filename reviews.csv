0,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Phones been amazingI have used iphone 4s , 5 , 6s and xr but I liked it.Long battery life, not quite as good as iPhone 13 but Close. Plus I didn’t like the weight and thickness of iPhone 13  just to get maybe 45-60 minutes more time at the most. I don’t see any difference in speed between Bionic14 and Bionic 15 what so ever. And to much hype for the 120 h refresh rate, no noticeable difference at all. Also I actually think iPhone 12 pictures look better than iPhone 13 because by supposedly having slight bit more detail they over saturate the black in them. Love the thin weightless feel in iPhone 12 and have had zero issues. I’m keeping this phone till the wheels fall off. Great value.",Yaswanth S.
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.PROS:1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn't have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.5.6. The dimensions of phone, it's smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.7. Overall build quality is great.8. Best audio output out there.9. Long term support.CONS:1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.5. Ridiculously expensive accessories6. Battery life is above good but not great.In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.",Avnish Chandra

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased iphone 12 in great Indian festival sale for 41500 excluding charger. Camera quality 5/5 , Battery 4.5/5(used you tube, Netflix, safari for anime, ig, whatsApp and battery lasted 1 1/2 day). Os is so smooth and easy to use. No blotware so big thumbs up. Got ios update16.1 . Build quality feels premium. (In hand use without back cover feels so good that i cannot explain). Iphone 12 is slightly lighter in weight.I even played apex legends and fps was constant, no lag,no heating issue. Hdr content is top notch. Plus it's 5g so I can easily use it for more than 5yrs.Overall after using iphone 12 for around 2months i can say it is worth it. Overall experience 5/5",Ankur p.

7,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not the first iPhone, so nothing more to review on iOS or iPhone, but something specific to this phone/ experience is jotted below.1. I upgraded from iPhone SE (1st gen) to this one. The migration was super smooth. Just power on and keep besides the old phone, in almost 30mins you are done. Everything including apps and app settings are migrated.2. Camera is really great.3. I wanted a small set, I guess iPhone 12 mini would have been an ideal choice. However, this is not bad, either.",Jayan
8,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Switched to IOS for the first time, was really very excited to get the iphone 12.Display is stunning but might feel small if ur switching from a 6.5inch androidSpeakers are amazing they are loud, clear and have dolby effects.Build quality is superb which is expected from appleFace id might sound a bit concerning but its well integrated and works flawlessly.Camera is simply superb for a 2020 phone the video quality is unmatched.Haptics are flagship level.Cons-battery isnt that good and needs to be charged once a day at the least sometimes even 2 times.no charger in box had to purchase 20w charger for 1.8kprovided cable doesnt feel very sturdyIOS 16 is filled with bugs and degraded battery life compared to ios 15( at the time of review)The network reception isnt that great (cellular) wifi is great",Manjula
